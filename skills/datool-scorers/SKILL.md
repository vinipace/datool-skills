# Develop Datool scorers

Use the configured Datool connection. See [connection and discovery](../datool/SKILL.md#connection-and-discovery) when setting up access or checking a required capability.

Read configuration/versions with scorers:read; saving needs scorers:write. test_scorer currently requires scorers:read, scorers:write, traces:read and datasets:read, even without optional dataset context.

Define what passes and which evidence is required before choosing the scorer. Keep independent criteria separate: structure/citation validity, grounding, coverage and annotation fidelity must not silently substitute for each other. For an exact JSON criterion, adapt [assets/exact-json.json](assets/exact-json.json), a create_scorer input that compares objects independently of key order while preserving array order. It is an example criterion, not a calibrated quality judge.

## Runtime and configuration

JavaScript and Python scorers use the project's configured sandbox providers, including previews and evaluations. JavaScript defines `function evaluate({ trace, datasetItem })`; Python defines `def evaluate(trace, dataset_item=None)` and receives dictionaries. Return a finite `score` between 0 and 1 and optionally `passed` and `reason`. Use `reason`, not `reasoning`, in the code's return value. Keep code self-contained; JavaScript does not accept module imports, exports or TypeScript syntax, and project modules are not mounted in the sandbox. The serialized code/trace/dataset payload is capped at 1 MiB. A saved scorer does not prove its sandbox is configured or reachable.

For a new LLM scorer, choose an available project provider/model explicitly: Gateway chat models use `provider: "vercel-ai-gateway"` with a creator/model ID; native evaluation models use a supported Gateway or `typesafe-ai` model with `modelType: "evaluation"`. Configure `messages` with system/user roles, and `choices` with unique labels and unique numeric scores. Configure `threshold` to classify numeric scores. Omitting `provider` retains the legacy server OpenAI path; it does not automatically select the project Gateway key. AI and sandbox provider credentials are configured in Project settings; MCP/CLI do not currently configure them.

Templates support `{{trace}}`, `{{input}}`, `{{output}}`, `{{expected}}`, `{{metadata}}`, `{{datasetItem}}` and nested selectors. Missing nested fields produce errors; select narrow fields instead of interpolating an entire large trace. `chainOfThought` requests an evidence-based assessment before the choice. For vision, use up to four `imagePaths` selectors such as `output.image.url`, without template braces; values must be HTTPS image URLs or supported base64 image data URLs. Use a model that supports the evidence and structured output format, then validate a real preview.

## Preview and version

```sh
datool scorers get scorer-id
datool scorers versions scorer-id
datool scorers version scorer-id --version-id immutable-version-id
datool scorers create --input @exact-json.json
datool scorers test --input @preview.json
datool scorers update scorer-id --expected-revision 2 --input @updated-scorer.json
```

The MCP equivalents are get_scorer, list_scorer_versions, get_scorer_version, create_scorer, test_scorer and update_scorer. Version lists page with nextCursor. Both create and update wrap the complete configuration in scorer; update additionally requires id and expectedRevision. On conflict, reload and reconcile instead of blindly increasing the revision.

A saved preview input is:

```json
{
  "scorerId": "scorer-id",
  "versionId": "immutable-version-id",
  "traceId": "trace-id",
  "datasetId": "dataset-id",
  "datasetItemId": "item-id",
  "datasetVersionId": "snapshot-id"
}
```

For inline configurations, replace scorerId/versionId with scorer; traceId is still required. Dataset context requires both datasetId and datasetItemId; datasetVersionId selects frozen expected outputs. Without it the preview uses the current item. The scorer executes against recorded trace evidence and returns persisted: false, meaning no score result is saved. It does record a scorer execution span, which is excluded from future scoring evidence. LLM and hosted sandbox previews can incur provider usage within the user's authorized work.

Span-backed cases run with the selected invocation subtree; legacy trace cases use their available trace evidence; requiredEvidence is no longer a scorer configuration field. Handle missing evidence in the criterion so it does not become an automatic pass. Return a passed classification or configure a numeric threshold. Execution errors produce null scores and must remain distinguishable from a valid zero. Keep LLM allowSkip intentional because gates reject skipped results by default.

Use `test_scorer` for bounded debugging of specific cases while editing a scorer. Once the goal is to assess and report judge behavior across multiple cases, use a named saved run under [judge calibration](#judge-calibration). Repeated previews do not substitute for that saved calibration record. Record immutable version IDs so later evaluations reproduce the tested scorer.

The UI also supports custom input/output samples through a separate preview endpoint; the shared test_scorer operation accepts one recorded case per call. To capture fresh evidence, use [run_app](../datool/references/apps.md) and read its returned trace before testing. For a changed judge against identical saved evidence, follow the [evaluation improvement loop](../datool-evaluations/SKILL.md#disciplined-improvement-loop).

## Runtime readiness

`check_scorer_runtime` is read-only configuration inspection for up to 10 scorer IDs; it does not call providers or establish authentication/connectivity. `probe_scorer_runtime` explicitly executes up to 3 on one representative `traceId`, optionally `spanId` and dataset context. Both accept `evaluatorVersionIds`. Probe needs scorers:read, scorers:write, traces:read and datasets:read, may incur usage, and retains execution spans without a saved evaluation. Dataset context requires both datasetId and datasetItemId. Discover these operations before use; generic CLI `agent call` works when a convenience alias is absent.

Use [span promotion and snapshots](../datool-datasets/SKILL.md#promote-production-spans-into-cases) to capture cases. A runtime error has a null score; distinguish it from a legitimate failing judgment. A persistent runtime failure blocks later requests to that runtime within the run; inspect diagnostics, provider request IDs and Retry-After before scaling. HTTP 429 alone does not establish an exhausted balance.

## Judge calibration

Calibration uses ordinary dataset cases, declared expected judgments and a named saved evaluation. Include known passes, known failures, missing-evidence examples and disagreements between criteria. Store declarations in dataset metadata or accompanying review notes; they describe expected judge decisions and do not replace the case's expectedOutput reference. Follow [evaluations](../datool-evaluations/SKILL.md) to execute the selected immutable scorer versions and retain the run URL and results. Keep a held-out set when assessing judge quality.

Compare every criterion's observed judgment with its declared expectation. A negative control correctly rejected by a judge is a calibration success even though its quality score is low; the ordinary all-pass quality gate is not a calibration-agreement gate. Report false passes, false failures, missing evidence and runtime errors separately. Recalibrate after changing a rubric, scorer revision, provider or model. Agreement with AI-labelled expectations is not independent human validation.

For brand extraction, adapt the included [calibration fixtures](assets/brand-extraction-calibration.json). The application repository also has [a calibration checker](https://github.com/vinpac/datool/blob/main/scripts/check-scorer-calibration.ts). Each synthetic fixture declares expected judgments independently. For the loading-placeholder fixture, known-brand context supplies no answer evidence: grounding rejects all emitted unsupported entities even with `isTextMentioned=false` or `mentionCount=0`; coverage passes because there are no supported brands omitted. Input validity separately fails. Missing response evidence produces skip for grounding and coverage under this explicit rubric. Do not generalize these choices to every extraction task.

Native evaluation models map provider choices to configured numeric scores and may expose confidence/probabilities when returned. They do not currently return explanations; do not fabricate one or describe confidence as a calibrated probability of correctness.

## Iteration

After saving and calibrating a changed judge, follow the [evaluation improvement loop](../datool-evaluations/SKILL.md#disciplined-improvement-loop) to re-score existing outputs and compare runs. Carry forward the exact scorer version IDs from calibration.
